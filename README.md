EFFICIENTLY AUTOMATING SELF-ASSEMBLED QUANTUM-DOT NANOFILM IMAGE SEGMENTATION

The use of nanotechnology has significantly advanced applied chemical research. This has driven the need for novel nanofilm image processing techniques to quantify and detect variations occurring on a molecular scale. Specifically, nanofilm researchers are often required to manually extract features from their image background due to the low contrast, translucent, and discontinuous edges of these films. I developed an application utilizing Python, which automates feature extraction and efficiently segments nanofilm samples over a chemical reaction time transition and which is notoriously difficult due to low contrast, translucent, and discontinuous edges. This research was presented at the FSU Student Research Symposium Poster in Panama City in April 2021 and won ‘Best Presentation.’
